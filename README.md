## Website for a Yoga Studio

### Introduction

This repository is showcasing my first Milestone Project for The Code Institute.
I have chosen to create a website for a Yoga Studio which I gave it the fictional brand name of "Domus Yoga" (DY). To create this project I've putted into practice skills and techniques developed and learnt during my learning journey so far. The technologies used are HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

The project is easy to navigate and fully responsive: it's provided with strategic calls to action in each page and sections and it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes.

## UX â€“ User Experience

### The who?
The website purpose is to attract new members to join DY, displaying a catchy offer for new members at the beginning of its homepage as well as the main features of DY. The website also aim to engage current members keeping them update about events and news, growing in this way a community. Finally, potential employees may find in DY a job opportunity.

### The what?
What new members want to achieve navigating the website is to find a Yoga course that it's accessible and flexible in a way that match their lifestyle completely. A DY course can be followed in studio or online to give the benefit to practice this discipline anytime and remotely. Current members want to learn more about Yoga, including its philosophy. They want also join workshops and retreats for a full immersion experience and the opportunity to make new friends!

### The how?
The website attracts new members with a call to action at the beginning of the homepage displaying a special offer create for them. The user immediately receive the information that DY offer remote courses. This can be also achieved by scrolling the homepage and find the section dedicated to Yoga on demand, at this point a call to action invite the user to discover more. Users are invited to subscribe to the newsletter to stay in touch with DY latest offers, events and news with the form provided in the footer section. Finally if the users wish to get in touch directly with DY the contact page provide a form for that, as well as other useful informations such as opening hours of the Studio and its location. Info on prices and classes can be found in the timetable page where users will be able to book classes with a simple click! Potential employees will find all the information they need in the "work with us" page.
