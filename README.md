## Website for a Yoga Studio

### Introduction

This repository is showcasing my first Milestone Project for The Code Institute.
I have chosen to create a website for a Yoga Studio which I gave it the fictional brand name of "Domus Yoga" (DY). To create this project I've putted into practice skills and techniques developed and learnt during my learning journey so far. The technologies used are HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

The project is easy to navigate and fully responsive: it's provided with strategic calls to action in each page and sections and it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes.

## UX – User Experience

### The who?
The website purpose is to attract new members to join DY, displaying a catchy offer for new members at the beginning of its homepage as well as the main features of DY. The website also aim to engage current members keeping them update about events and news, growing in this way a community. Finally, potential employees may find in DY a job opportunity.

### The what?
What new members want to achieve navigating the website is to find a Yoga course that it's accessible and flexible in a way that match their lifestyle completely. A DY course can be followed in studio or online to give the benefit to practice this discipline anytime and remotely. Current members want to learn more about Yoga, including its philosophy. They want also join workshops and retreats for a full immersion experience and the opportunity to make new friends!

### The how?
The website attracts new members with a call to action at the beginning of the homepage displaying a special offer create for them. The user immediately receive the information that DY offer remote courses. This can be also achieved by scrolling the homepage and find the section dedicated to Yoga on demand, at this point a call to action invite the user to discover more. Users are invited to subscribe to the newsletter to stay in touch with DY latest offers, events and news with the form provided in the footer section. Finally if the users wish to get in touch directly with DY the contact page provide a form for that, as well as other useful informations such as opening hours of the Studio and its location. Info on prices and classes can be found in the timetable page where users will be able to book classes with a simple click! Potential employees will find all the information they need in the "work with us" page.

# Validation

In this section I will be showing the validation techniques used in order to make my project compliant. I have used the W3C HTML5 and CSS3 online validation tools. I have also runned the Lighthouse report from Chrome Developer Tools.

CSS3 Validation -> [Visit Site]( https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Validation Testing Document -> [Visit Document](testing/validation-testing.md)

# Testing

In this section I will be testing my project by going over my User Stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended.

### UX User Story Testing Document -> [Visit Document](testing/ux-testing.md)

I have tested my project on Google Chrome and Firefox. In both browsers all pages, sections, fonts, images of the project work well as well as its responsiveness. 
Using Chrome Dev responsive tools whilst programming helped me to simulate different sizes device, including landscape view. 

## Interesting Bugs

While working on the 3rd section of the homepage I was finding difficult to adapt the content to landscape view on smarthphones. Using a media query aimed at adapting the height of the section to smartphones I was able to resolve this problem. After discovering this I could improve the appearance of other sections too!

# Known Issues

Timetable Page - The form which I used just before the timetable (the one that include the Week which the timetable is refering) it is not the desired one. I aimed to use a form which had arrow on the left and right to navigate the wee timeline. Since I used Bootstrap for all my forms I could not find anything like that. 

Timetable Page, Desktop view - when viewed on desktop view the timetable is very basic, I will make it more interactive on a later date as I develop further skills.
