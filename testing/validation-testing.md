# Validation Testing

## Homepage (index.html)

The first time I have run the HTML5 online validation test for index.html, the document came out with some minor errors due to the id="navbarNAvDropdown" being repetead needlessly and some minor tuping errors. These have been promptly fixed so I've run a second test straight away which came out without errors.

## Contact Page (contact.html)

After I have run the HTML5 online validation test for contact.html, the document came out with an error regarding the table sintax in the opening hours section.

After correcting the sintax the document came out with no errors.

The HTML5 online validation test came up with no errors. The document shows warnings regarding the choice of giving a quantity of columns that is different from the quantity choosen for the rows.

## CSS (style.css)

The CSS3 online validation came up with no errors. The document shows warnings regarding unknown vendor extension used to create transictions and some warnings regarding the color choices. These warnings did not impact the CSS3 validation.
